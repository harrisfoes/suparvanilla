# supervanilla

After an agonizing few months of learning React I soon came to the realization that there are glaring gaps in my knowledge

The supervanilla project is an attempt to plug those holes and gain a deep understanding of the JavaScript language instead.

My previous goal was to get a job, and so I resorted to little 'hacks' in order to get my foot in the door as soon as possible.

That approach was bad.

The goal was transactional, meaning I felt that I was wasting time every time my efforts were unrewarded. Failure and rejection felt like a wall, instead of a learning experience.

Now our approach will be to learn 'Craft' so we can be of 'Service'.

With this approach, every difficulty will be for a greater cause. My effort will be freely given and I won't ask for anything in return. Every percieved failure will become a learning experience instead.
